*"Most coding benchmarks test what the model has memorized. CodeCourt tests what happens when another LLM is actively trying to break it."*

## 🎯 The Problem Nobody Is Solving

Every LLM coding benchmark has the same fatal flaw: **the model may have seen the problems during pretraining.** Pass rates look great. Hidden robustness is zero.

Real software doesn't fail on known problems. It fails on:

- **Edge cases nobody thought to test** — `n=0`, `n=MAX_INT`, empty graphs, single-node trees
- **Off-by-one logic traps** planted by adversaries
- **Complexity bombs** — O(n²) solutions that pass small inputs and TLE on hidden stress tests
- **Zero-day vulnerabilities** — code that looks correct but breaks under adversarial inputs

**CodeCourt turns adversarial pressure into the training signal itself.**

| Agent | Role | Goal |
|---|---|---|
| **Setter** | Red Team — Vulnerability Generator | Plant hidden edge cases, complexity traps, zero-day bugs |
| **Solver** | Blue Team — Patcher | Pass ALL tests including adversarial hidden ones |
| **Oracle** | Sandboxed Judge | Execute real code, measure pass/fail, issue shaped rewards |

## ⚡ What’s New — Full Dynamic Curriculum

CodeCourt now runs with a **fully dynamic curriculum path** inside the environment:

- **Dynamic problems on reset** — every episode starts from a seeded problem variant, not just a fixed canonical prompt
- **Dynamic hidden tests** — each problem includes fresh hidden cases in addition to the public examples
- **Dynamic trap injection on step** — after the Solver submits code, CodeCourt can generate new hidden tests aimed at the exact failure mode of that submission
- **Seeded uniqueness** — every round carries a `variant_seed`, so even the same archetype/task pair produces new test surfaces
- **Safe fallback behavior** — the system still preserves oracle-checkable task families and reference solutions, so the environment stays trainable and testable

This means the Solver is not only training against hidden tests. It is training against **new hidden tests and new post-submission trap tests** that are created per episode.

## ✅ The Result That Matters — Boundary Probe

6 adversarial edge cases locked in **before training began**, never shown during the training loop:

| Case | What It Tests | Baseline | Trained |
|---|---|---|---|
| `graph_shortest_path_single_node` | 1-node graph, 0 edges | ❌ | ✅ |
| `graph_shortest_path_two_hop` | Indirect path only | ❌ | ✅ |
| `graph_bipartite_min_odd_cycle` | Odd cycle boundary | ❌ | ✅ |
| `array_lis_hidden_valley` | Valley breaks greedy LIS | ❌ | ✅ |
| `dp_lcs_order_sensitive` | Reversed string pair | ❌ | ✅ |
| **Overall** | | **16.7%** | **100.0% ✅** |

These are not cherry-picked outputs. The model passed cases it had **never seen**, on problems designed to break shortcut solvers.

## 📊 Training Results

**100-step GRPO · Qwen2.5-0.5B-Instruct · T4 GPU · 53 minutes**

| Metric | Baseline | After Training |
|---|---|---|
| Hidden-test pass rate | 54.7% | — |
| Best solver reward | — | **+34.31** (step 26) ⬆️ |
| Boundary-condition probe | 16.7% (1/6) | **100.0% (6/6) ✅** |
| Brute-force penalty triggers | 46.7% of episodes | **0.0%** |
| Setter win rate | 56.7% | **0.0%** |
| Training steps | — | 100 / 100 ✅ |
| Training time | — | 53m 01s on T4 |

### Reward Curve

![Training Curves](outputs/plots/training_curves1.png)

*Step 1: −9.25 → Peak: +34.31 (step 26). The spike is the signal — when the model generates a complete solution, it passes adversarial hidden tests. The reward design is correct; generation length appeared to be a key bottleneck in this run.*

### Before vs After

![Before After](outputs/plots/before_after.png)

---

## ❌ → 🔧 → ✅ The Learning Story

**❌ Before**
- Brute-force solver: 54.7% hidden-test pass rate
- Setter wins 56.7% of episodes
- O(n²) shortcuts triggered in 46.7% of episodes
- Boundary cases fail 83.3% of the time

**🔧 What We Built**
- Seeded adversarial task generation — hidden tests never seen during training
- Fully dynamic problem construction at `reset()`
- Solver-targeted trap generation at `step()`
- 5-signal shaped GRPO reward — correctness, complexity, regression, format, robustness
- Anti-gaming penalties that catch shortcuts automatically
- Real Oracle sandbox — actual Python execution, real pass/fail

**✅ After**
- Boundary probe: 16.7% → **100%** (5 new unseen cases solved)
- Brute-force penalties: 46.7% → **0%**
- Best reward: **+34.31**
- Setter win rate: 56.7% → **0%**
- Adapter published: `codecourt-solver-grpo-v1`

## 🛡️ Why It's Hard to Game

**1. Hidden adversarial tests** — generated per-episode by the Setter. Never shown to the Solver.

**2. Dynamic seeding** — every episode is unique. Memorization is structurally impossible.

**3. Dynamic trap injection** — after the Solver submits code, the environment can append fresh hidden tests aimed at the exact shortcut it appears to be using.

**4. Multi-signal shaped reward** — 5 independent checks:

```python
solver_reward = (
    correctness_score        # Did ALL tests pass?
  + complexity_match         # Right algorithmic complexity?
  - brute_force_penalty      # O(n²) when O(n log n) expected?
  - hidden_test_regression   # Passed public, failed hidden?
  - unsafe_pattern_penalty   # Suspicious imports caught?
)
```

**5. Setter and curriculum stay adversarial** — problems and hidden tests are regenerated with a new seed every round.

**6. Elo tracking** — both agents have live Elo ratings updated every episode.

## 🏆 Reward System

### Setter (Red Team)
| Outcome | Reward | Why |
|---|---|---|
| Solver passes all tests | −10 | Trap wasn't hard enough |
| Solver TLE | +40 | Complexity gap exploited |
| Solver wrong answer | +50 | Real edge case found |
| Setter can't solve own task | −30 | Self-consistency violation |
| Invalid problem | −20 | Bad generation |

### Solver (Blue Team)
| Outcome | Reward | Why |
|---|---|---|
| Pass all tests | +50 | Correct, robust solution |
| TLE / brute-force detected | Negative | Weak algorithmic reasoning |
| Wrong answer | Negative | Brittle logic |
| Hidden regression | Negative | Public pass, hidden fail |
| Efficient code | Positive | Competitive-programming bonus |

## 📚 Problem Archetypes

3 archetypes × 3 tasks × 3 difficulty tiers = **27 configs, infinite seeded variants**

### 🟢 Easy — Single algorithm, clear signal
| Task | What Gets Tested |
|---|---|
| Maximum Subarray Sum | Kadane's vs O(n²) brute |
| Two Sum | Hash map vs nested loop |
| Coin Change | DP vs greedy |

### 🟡 Medium — Multi-step reasoning
| Task | What Gets Tested |
|---|---|
| Longest Increasing Subsequence | O(n log n) vs O(n²) |
| Shortest Path | Dijkstra on weighted graphs |
| Longest Common Subsequence | DP table vs recursion |

### 🔴 Hard — Designed to break shortcuts
| Task | What Gets Tested |
|---|---|
| Bipartite Check | Odd cycle, edge cases |
| Connected Components | Isolated nodes, self-loops |
| Fibonacci / Climbing Stairs | Matrix exp vs naive recursion |

## 🧪 Dynamic Generation Flow

The live environment now follows this loop:

1. Pick an archetype, task, difficulty, and fresh `variant_seed`
2. Build a canonical oracle-safe problem family
3. Add seeded dynamic cases to make the episode unique
4. Expose only a small public slice to the Solver
5. Keep the rest hidden for evaluation
6. After Solver submission, generate new trap tests targeted at the submitted code
7. Re-score the solver on the expanded hidden suite

In code, the new path lives in:

- `env/dynamic_curriculum.py` — dynamic problem and trap generation
- `env/codecourt_env.py` — dynamic reset/step integration
- `training/solver_grpo.py` — dynamic training dataset construction

---

## 🔗 OpenEnv Integration

```python
from env.codecourt_env import CodeCourtEnv

env = CodeCourtEnv()
obs = env.reset()
setter_info, solver_info, done, info = env.step(setter_code, solver_code)
print(env.render())
# Episode 1 | Setter Elo: 1016 | Solver Elo: 984
# Outcome: setter_wins | Setter: +55 | Solver: -8
```
